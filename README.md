# Project4CS180 Documentation
### Compiling & Running
- mainClass contains a main method that is used to run the program.
            - Main includes static methods from other classes, so they need to be compiled
- In order to run the code in Vocareum, first cd into the correct folder cd Project4CS180/src
- To update the messages screen to view new messages, you need to click on the button that corresponds with the page you are on
	- we asked a TA, Mr. Nathaniel J krakauer if our implementation was fine, and we got the green light so we kept this as is.
### Submissions
- Manas Paranjape submitted the code on Vocareum
- Rishabh Pandey submitted the video and presentation on Brightspace
- Kevin Ma submitted the report on Brightspace
