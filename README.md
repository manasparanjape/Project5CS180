# Project4CS180 Documentation

### Compiling & Running
- Main class contains a main method that is used to run the program.
- Main includes static methods from other classes, so they need to be compiled
- In order to run the code in Vocareum, first cd into the correct folder: $ cd Project4CS180/src

### Submissions
- Manas Paranjape submitted the code on Vocareum
- Rishabh Pandey submitted the report on Brightspace
### Descriptions of Classes
- Main
    - Consists of methods that are used in the creation and deletion of accounts. All the accounts, both students and teachers, are written to the Accounts.txt file. Changes to accounts are made to the Accounts.txt file. 
    - Methods:
      - ConvertToString 
        - creates an output string for each user with all their information separated using “§§§”
        - Ex. username§§§password§§§firstN§§§lastN§§§ifTeacher 
      - write + read file 
        - reads text file to an ArrayList inside an ArrayList called “output” 
        - ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> output = new ArrayList<>(); 
        - Sets the output to an array list called accountDetailsArray 
        - uses split() to read values 
      - checkUsernameAvailability 
        - uses a while loop to check the first index of every array (first index is the username value)
        - username is not case sensitive 
      - getNewAccountDetails
        - prompts the user to input a username, password, first name, and last name
        - checks for their availability
        - creates account and writes it to the Accounts.txt file
      - findAccount
        - reads the Accounts.txt file and checks if the first index (username) matches the username parameter
      - securityCheck
        - takes the username and password input from the user and checks whether it matches with what is stored in the Accounts.txt file
        - has a return value of 0, 1, or 2 which equals invalid, student. or teacher, respectively
      - deleteAccount
        - checks if the user is signed in first, using the securityCheck method
        - goes through the array list of accounts and checks if the first index (username) is equal to the username of the logged in user
        - overwrites the Accounts.txt file with all the users except the one that had the matching username as the if-condition.
        - if(!accountDetailsArray.get(i).get(0).equals(username)){...}
      - main
        - Runs as the primary method and allows users to access their account, create their account or delete it.
